# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Phase 3C | Active | Current release — full security support |
| Phase 3B | Critical fixes only | Security patches only, no new features |
| < Phase 3B | End of life | No longer supported — please upgrade |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in the MACP Research Assistant, please report it responsibly through one of the following channels:

### Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories

Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/macp-research-assistant/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities privately. This allows us to collaborate on a fix before public disclosure.

### Alternative: Email

**Contact:** alton@ysenseai.org

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected version(s)
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes
- Your contact information for follow-up

### What NOT to Do

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not** share vulnerability details publicly before they are fixed
- **Do not** exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

## Response Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Within **48 hours** of report |
| Initial assessment | Within **7 days** |
| Critical severity fix | Within **14 days** |
| High severity fix | Within **30 days** |
| Medium/Low severity fix | Within **90 days** |

## Coordinated Disclosure Policy

We follow a **90-day coordinated disclosure** window. After reporting a vulnerability:

1. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. We will assess severity and develop a fix
3. We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing
4. After the fix is released, you are free to publish your findings
5. If 90 days pass without a fix, you may disclose at your discretion

We credit all reporters in our security advisories unless anonymity is requested.

## Security Practices

### Infrastructure Security

- Deployed on GCP Cloud Run with gVisor sandboxing and instance caps
- All API keys and credentials managed through Cloud Run environment variables — never committed to code
- Container runs as non-root user (`appuser`) for defense-in-depth
- HTTPS enforced via HSTS headers; TLS terminated by Cloud Run
- Rate limiting (3-tier: guest, authenticated, premium) prevents abuse

### Code Security

- **Bandit** (SAST) — Static Application Security Testing for Python code
- **Safety** (SCA) — Software Composition Analysis for dependency vulnerabilities
- **npm audit** — Frontend dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL** — Semantic code analysis via GitHub Actions (Python + TypeScript)
- **Ruff** — Python linting on every push and pull request
- LLM prompt injection protection via `sanitize_llm_input()` with pattern filtering
- Input validation via Pydantic models on all API endpoints
- Error messages sanitized — no internal details exposed to clients

### Security Headers

All responses include:

- `Content-Security-Policy` — Restricts script/style/font/frame sources
- `Strict-Transport-Security` — HSTS with 1-year max-age
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` — Disables camera, microphone, geolocation

### Access Control

- GitHub OAuth for user authentication (JWT in HttpOnly cookies)
- Branch protection rules enforce status checks before merging
- Dependabot monitors dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- CORS restricted to specific origins, methods, and headers

### Operational Security

- Structured JSON audit logging compatible with GCP Cloud Logging
- Security audits conducted via CS Agent v3.1 Multi-Stage Verification Protocol
- Security findings tracked through the FLYWHEEL TEAM multi-agent validation protocol

## Security Scanning Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Bandit | Python SAST | Every push/PR + weekly |
| Safety | Dependency vulnerability check | Every push/PR + weekly |
| npm audit | Frontend dependency check | Every push/PR + weekly |
| CodeQL | Semantic code analysis | Every push/PR + weekly |
| Ruff | Python linting | Every push/PR |
| Dependabot | Automated dependency updates | Weekly |

## Known Vulnerabilities

No known unpatched vulnerabilities at this time. See [Security Advisories](https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/macp-research-assistant/security/advisories) for historical disclosures.
