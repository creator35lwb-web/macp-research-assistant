  "title": "MACP Research Assistant: Multi-Agent Communication Protocol for Traceable AI-Powered Research",
  "description": "MACP Research Assistant is an open-source tool for tracking, tracing, and recalling AI-powered research with complete citation provenance across multiple AI assistants. This is a defensive publication establishing prior art for the following innovations: (1) MACP-based research tracking — using the Multi-Agent Communication Protocol v2.0 to create full provenance chains across multi-AI research workflows, (2) C-S-P Research Methodology — applying the GodelAI Conflict-Synthesis-Propagation framework to research paper discovery, insight extraction, and knowledge application, (3) Knowledge Recall System — enabling natural language queries across structured research history (papers, learning sessions, citations), (4) Agent-Attributed Citation Networks — linking every citation to the specific AI agent that produced it, with handoff traceability, (5) AI Agent Discoverability Standards — adopting llms.txt and skill.md standards to make research tools natively discoverable and usable by other AI agents, positioning MACP as proto-A2A infrastructure for the agentic web.",

Key innovations: (1) MACP-based research provenance tracking across multiple AI agents, (2) C-S-P research methodology (Conflict=multi-pipeline discovery, Synthesis=insight extraction, Propagation=citation into projects), (3) Agent-attributed citation networks with handoff traceability, (4) AI-native discoverability via llms.txt and skill.md standards. Developed through multi-agent collaboration by the YSenseAI FLYWHEEL TEAM: Alton Lee (Human Orchestrator), Godel/Manus AI (CTO/Strategy), and Claude Code (Implementation). The architecture positions MACP as proto-Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure for the emerging agentic web, complementing MCP (tool access) with structured inter-agent communication.",
