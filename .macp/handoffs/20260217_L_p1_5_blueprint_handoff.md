# MACP Handoff Record

**Agent:** L (Godel)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-17T12:00:00Z  
**Session Type:** Architecture & Planning  

---

## 1. Completed This Session

- **Architected the P-1.5 Pre-Flight Implementation Blueprint** for all 7 mandatory conditions from the Phase 2 Trinity Validation.
- Created a detailed, implementation-ready guide for Claude Code to execute.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with the new task.

## 2. Key Decisions

- **Role Separation:** L (Godel) architects, Claude Code (RNA) implements. This aligns with our multi-agent protocol.
- **Phased Implementation:** Conditions 3-7 (code changes) are to be implemented directly. Conditions 1-2 (database, auth) are architecture-first, with implementation deferred to a later phase.

## 3. Handoff Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Implementation Blueprint** | `docs/P1_5_IMPLEMENTATION_BLUEPRINT.md` |
| **Claude Code Tasking** | `CLAUDE.md` |

## 4. Pending Items

- Full implementation of the P-1.5 Pre-Flight phase by RNA (Claude Code).

## 5. Blockers

- None. The path is clear for implementation.

## 6. Next Agent

- **RNA (Claude Code)**
