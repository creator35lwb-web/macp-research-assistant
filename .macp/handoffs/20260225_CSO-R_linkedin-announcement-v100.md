### Introducing MACP Research Assistant v1.0.0 — The First Multi-Agent Consensus Research Platform

I am excited to announce the public release of **MACP Research Assistant v1.0.0** — an open-source, AI-powered research platform that brings something genuinely new to the scientific research workflow: **multi-agent consensus analysis**.

**The Problem We Solved**

Every existing AI research tool — Semantic Scholar, Elicit, Consensus, Scite — uses a single AI model to analyze papers. But single-model analysis carries inherent bias. When GPT-4 says a paper is "highly relevant," how do you know that is not just one model's perspective?

**Our Approach: Let Multiple AI Models Debate**

MACP Research Assistant sends the same paper to up to 5 different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq) and generates a **consensus analysis** using a weighted scoring algorithm (40% key findings overlap + 30% relevance alignment + 30% methodology consistency). Each agent's analysis is stored separately with a mandatory bias disclaimer, and the consensus captures both convergence and divergence points.

This is not a theoretical framework — it is a production application running at [macpresearch.ysenseai.org](https://macpresearch.ysenseai.org).

**What Makes This Different**

After conducting market research across the AI research tools landscape, we confirmed that MACP Research Assistant is the **first platform** to offer:

- **Multi-LLM Consensus Analysis** — No existing tool uses multiple distinct LLMs to analyze the same paper and generate consensus. Stanford's Virtual Lab, Anthropic's multi-agent system, and McKinsey's proposed agents all use multi-agent architectures, but none apply them to cross-model paper analysis with bias cross-checking.

- **GitHub-Integrated Research Journey** — Every paper, analysis, and consensus is synced to a GitHub repository following the MACP v2.0 directory standard. Your research journey becomes a version-controlled, auditable, machine-readable knowledge base that any AI agent can read and continue.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — No AI research tool in the current market is a PWA. MACP Research Assistant works offline, is installable on any device, and uses intelligent caching strategies per endpoint type.

- **BYOK Privacy Guarantee** — Bring Your Own API Key with a code-audited guarantee: your keys are never stored, logged, or transmitted. Request-only memory, garbage collected after each call.

- **Perplexity-Powered Deep Research** — Integrated deep research using Perplexity Sonar Pro for real-time web-grounded analysis with source citations.

**Built by a FLYWHEEL TEAM**

This project was built by a 2-agent team (CSO R on Manus AI + CTO RNA on Claude Code) coordinated through the Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol (MACP v2.0). The entire development — from concept to production — was completed in approximately 6 weeks with 130+ commits, 26 handoff documents, and zero infrastructure cost beyond free-tier services.

The development process itself is a proof-of-concept for MACP v2.0: two AI agents, different platforms, different capabilities, collaborating through structured handoffs on GitHub. The protocol we built to coordinate our own development is the same protocol the application implements for research.

**The Numbers**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Papers Searchable | 12,800+ (HuggingFace Daily Papers) |
| LLM Providers | 5 (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq) |
| WebMCP Endpoints | 13 |
| Registered Agents | 6 |
| Commits | 130+ |
| Code Scanning Alerts | 0 |
| Infrastructure Cost | $0 (free-tier only) |

**What is Next**

Phase 4 brings knowledge graph visualization, research templates, and integration with VerifiMind-PEAS — our MCP server for AI validation. The goal: a complete research-to-validation pipeline where AI agents can discover papers, analyze them from multiple perspectives, build consensus, and apply findings to real projects.

## Market Research Summary (Perplexity Sonar Pro — 2026-02-25)

### Competitive Positioning

The Perplexity deep research confirmed that MACP Research Assistant occupies a unique position in the market. The following table summarizes the competitive landscape:

| Tool | Multi-LLM Consensus | GitHub Integration | PWA | BYOK | Open Source | Price |
|------|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:---:|:----:|:-----------:|-------|
| Semantic Scholar | No | No | No | N/A | Partial | Free |
| Elicit | No | No | No | No | No | $10/mo |
| Consensus | No | No | No | No | No | $9.99/mo |
| ResearchRabbit | No | No | No | N/A | No | Free |
| Connected Papers | No | No | No | N/A | No | Freemium |
| Scite | No | No | No | No | No | $20/mo |
| Litmaps | No | No | No | N/A | No | Freemium |
| **MACP Research Assistant** | **Yes (5 LLMs)** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Free** |

### Key Market Gaps Addressed

The research identified three critical gaps in the current market that no existing tool addresses:

1. **Cross-model bias detection** — All existing tools use a single AI model. MACP is the first to implement multi-LLM consensus with explicit bias cross-checking and divergence tracking.

2. **Version-controlled research journeys** — No tool tracks the full research lifecycle (discovery → analysis → consensus → deep research) in a machine-readable, version-controlled format on GitHub.

3. **Agent-to-Agent research continuity** — No tool enables one AI agent to pick up where another left off using a standardized protocol (MACP v2.0 schema + agent registry).

### Multi-Agent Research State of the Art

The Perplexity research confirmed that while multi-agent systems are advancing rapidly (Stanford Virtual Lab, Anthropic's orchestrator-worker, McKinsey's clinical agents), none specifically implement multi-LLM consensus for paper analysis. MACP Research Assistant is the first production implementation of this approach.

## VerifiMind-PEAS Validation Alignment

This LinkedIn announcement should be cross-referenced with the VerifiMind-PEAS validation report (Phase 4 of this session) to ensure all claims are evidence-backed and bias-checked. The FLYWHEEL TEAM practices what it preaches — even our marketing materials go through multi-agent validation.
