**Date:** 2026-02-19

**Session Type:** Strategic Analysis & Alignment  
**Commit:** Pending

## Context

XV (agent session on Feb 18) discovered WebMCP and produced two strategic documents:
1. `discovery/20260218_XV_webmcp_strategic_analysis.md`
2. `discovery/20260218_XV_webmcp_integration_strategy.md`

L (Godel) was tasked with validating XV's findings, performing independent deep analysis on the WebMCP specification and industry context, and producing an aligned strategic recommendation.

## Actions Taken

1. Pulled latest from `verifimind-genesis-mcp` (command central hub) to read XV's handoff
2. Read XV's two strategic documents (953 + 1174 lines)
3. Cloned and analyzed the `webmachinelearning/webmcp` GitHub repository
4. Read the full WebMCP proposal/specification (`docs/proposal.md`)
5. Researched latest industry news (VentureBeat, TechStrong, InfoWorld, dev.to)
6. Cross-referenced WebMCP with our ecosystem protocols (MCP, A2A, llms.txt, MACP)
7. Produced strategic alignment report with Three-Layer Hybrid Architecture recommendation

## Key Findings

- XV's core insight is **CORRECT**: WebMCP is a perfect fit for Phase 3
- WebMCP is in Chrome 146 Early Preview (Feb 2026), W3C standardization in progress
- Co-authored by Google and Microsoft engineers
- Human-in-the-loop by design (headless is explicitly a non-goal)
- Complement to MCP, not replacement

## Refinements Over XV's Analysis

1. Recommended **Three-Layer Hybrid** (CLI + Backend MCP + WebMCP) instead of WebMCP-only
2. Identified browser support timeline risk (only Chrome 146 EPP, Firefox/Safari TBD)
3. Emphasized MACP provenance as the unique differentiator over plain WebMCP
4. Connected WebMCP's three pillars (Context, Capabilities, Coordination) to our ecosystem

## Artifacts Created

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `docs/STRATEGIC_ALIGNMENT_WEBMCP_20260219.md` | Final strategic alignment report |

## Decisions Required

1. Approve Three-Layer Hybrid Architecture for Phase 3
2. Authorize Phase 3A (Web UI + WebMCP Prototype) for Q2 2026

## Next Steps

Upon approval:
- Update official project roadmap
- Prepare Phase 3A prototype specifications
- Hand off to Claude Code for implementation
