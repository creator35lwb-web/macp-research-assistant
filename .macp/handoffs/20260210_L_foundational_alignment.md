# MACP Handoff Record: Foundational Alignment

**ID:** `handoff-20260210-L-001`
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**From:** L (Godel) / Manus AI
**To:** All YSenseAI Ecosystem Agents

## 1. Handoff Summary

This handoff concludes a critical foundational alignment session for the `macp-research-assistant` repository. The primary objective was to address the critical issues identified in the deep analysis report and align the project with the latest ecosystem-wide strategic documents (`Multi-Project Conflict Assessment` and `Unified Roadmap`).

This session successfully transitioned the repository from a misleading, non-functional state to an honest, well-documented conceptual blueprint with a solid, secure, and ethical foundation.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

### 2.1. Foundational Fixes (Phase 3)

-   **README Honesty:** The main `README.md` has been significantly updated to include a prominent warning about the project's pre-alpha status. It now accurately reflects the conceptual nature of the repository and removes all references to non-existent files and tools.
-   **Ecosystem Alignment:** The `README.md` now includes an "Ecosystem Alignment" section that correctly positions this project within the YSenseAI ecosystem, linking to the `verifimind-genesis-mcp` command hub and the Unified Roadmap.
-   **Protocol Realignment:** A new `docs/ECOSYSTEM_ALIGNMENT.md` file was created to formally document the relationship between the simplified MACP in this repo and the authoritative MACP v2.0 in the central hub.

### 2.2. Trinity Validation Implementation (Phase 4)

All mandatory conditions from the VerifiMind-PEAS Trinity Validation have been implemented:

-   **Security (CS-Agent):**
    -   A comprehensive `.gitignore` file has been added to prevent secrets from being committed.
    -   Guidance on JSON schema validation has been added to the `MACP_SPECIFICATION.md`.
-   **Ethics (Z-Agent):**
    -   A new `docs/ETHICAL_USE_GUIDELINES.md` file has been created, addressing dual-use risks, democratic access, and data privacy.
-   **Innovation (X-Agent):**
    -   Formal JSON schemas for all five core data files (`research_papers.json`, `learning_log.json`, `citations.json`, `knowledge_graph.json`, `handoffs.json`) have been created and placed in a new `/schemas` directory.

## 3. Artifacts Created/Modified

-   `/README.md` (Major Revision)
-   `/docs/ECOSYSTEM_ALIGNMENT.md` (New)
-   `/docs/MACP_SPECIFICATION.md` (Updated)
-   `/docs/ETHICAL_USE_GUIDELINES.md` (New)
-   `/.gitignore` (New)
-   `/schemas/research_papers_schema.json` (New)
-   `/schemas/learning_log_schema.json` (New)
-   `/schemas/citations_schema.json` (New)
-   `/schemas/knowledge_graph_schema.json` (New)
-   `/schemas/handoffs_schema.json` (New)

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Commit & Push:** Commit all changes to the `macp-research-assistant` repository with a detailed commit message.
2.  **Deliver Results:** Report the completion of this foundational alignment to the user (Alton), providing access to all created artifacts via the GitHub repository.
3.  **Await further instructions** for Phase 2 development (building the semi-automated tools).
