        "summary": "This paper introduces ReAct, a method that combines reasoning and acting in large language models by having them generate both thought processes and actions in an interleaved manner. The approach allows models to interact with external information sources like Wikipedia while reasoning through problems, reducing errors like hallucination. ReAct significantly outperforms existing methods on question answering, fact verification, and interactive decision-making tasks.",

          "Interleaving reasoning traces with task-specific actions creates synergy where reasoning guides action planning and actions provide external information to improve reasoning",

          "The method achieves 34% and 10% absolute success rate improvements over imitation and reinforcement learning on interactive decision-making tasks with minimal in-context examples",
          "Generated trajectories are more interpretable and human-like compared to methods using only reasoning or only acting",
