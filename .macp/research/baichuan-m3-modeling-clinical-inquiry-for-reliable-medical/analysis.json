        "summary": "Baichuan-M3 is a new AI medical assistant that acts more like a real doctor by asking questions to gather information, rather than just answering patient questions. It can actively investigate symptoms, reason through complex medical cases, and avoid making up false information. The system outperforms existing AI models including GPT-5.2 on medical decision-making tasks.",
        "key_insights": [
          "Shifts medical AI from passive question-answering to active clinical inquiry, mimicking how physicians systematically gather patient information",
          "Implements three core capabilities: proactive information gathering, long-horizon reasoning to connect scattered evidence, and adaptive hallucination suppression for factual accuracy",
          "Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HealthBench, HealthBench-Hallu, and ScanBench, outperforming GPT-5.2 in clinical inquiry, advisory quality, and safety",
          "Uses specialized training pipeline to model systematic physician workflows for more reliable medical decision support"
        ],
        "methodology": "The model employs a specialized training pipeline that teaches the system to follow physician-like workflows, incorporating proactive questioning, evidence synthesis, and hallucination control mechanisms.",
