        "summary": "This paper provides the first comprehensive survey examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research workflows. The authors systematically analyze LLM applications across four key stages: generating research hypotheses, planning and conducting experiments, writing scientific papers, and peer reviewing manuscripts. The survey identifies current challenges and proposes future directions for using AI to accelerate scientific discovery.",
        "key_insights": [
          "LLMs are being applied across the entire scientific research lifecycle, from initial hypothesis generation through peer review, representing a fundamental shift in how research is conducted",
          "Each stage of research has developed task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks for LLM integration, though standardization remains limited",
          "Current challenges include ensuring factual accuracy, handling domain-specific knowledge, maintaining scientific rigor, and addressing ethical concerns about AI-generated research",
          "The survey identifies significant gaps in evaluation frameworks and the need for better integration of LLMs with existing scientific tools and databases"
        ],
        "methodology": "Systematic literature survey analyzing existing research on LLM applications across four critical stages of the scientific research process, including review of methodologies and evaluation benchmarks.",
