## Abstract

In recent years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of scientific research, offering unprecedented support across various stages of the research cycle. This paper presents the first systematic survey dedicated to exploring how LLMs are revolutionizing the scientific research process. We analyze the unique roles LLMs play across four critical stages of research: hypothesis discovery, experiment planning and implementation, scientific writing, and peer reviewing. Our review comprehensively showcases the task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. By identifying current challenges and proposing future research directions, this survey not only highlights the transformative potential of LLMs, but also aims to inspire and guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging LLMs to advance scientific inquiry.

## Key Insights

- LLMs are being applied across the entire scientific research lifecycle, from initial hypothesis generation through peer review, representing a fundamental shift in how research is conducted
- Each research stage requires task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks tailored to the unique requirements of scientific work
- Current LLM applications in science face significant challenges including domain-specific knowledge limitations, evaluation difficulties, and the need for specialized benchmarks
- The integration of LLMs into scientific workflows has transformative potential but requires careful consideration of reliability, reproducibility, and domain expertise
- Each stage of research has developed task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks for LLM integration, though standardization remains limited
- Current challenges include ensuring factual accuracy, handling domain-specific knowledge, maintaining scientific rigor, and addressing ethical concerns about AI-generated research
- The survey identifies significant gaps in evaluation frameworks and the need for better integration of LLMs with existing scientific tools and databases

## Analysis

**Summary:** This paper provides the first comprehensive survey examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research workflows. The authors systematically analyze LLM applications across four key stages: generating research hypotheses, planning and conducting experiments, writing scientific papers, and peer reviewing manuscripts. The survey identifies current challenges and proposes future directions for using AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

**Methodology:** Systematic literature survey analyzing existing research on LLM applications across four critical stages of the scientific research process, including review of methodologies and evaluation benchmarks.

**Strength Score:** 8/10

### Research Gaps

- Lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks across different scientific domains and research stages
- Limited understanding of how to ensure factual accuracy and prevent hallucinations in scientific contexts
- Insufficient frameworks for ethical integration of LLMs while maintaining scientific integrity and proper attribution
