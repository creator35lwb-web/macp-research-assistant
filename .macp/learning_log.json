      "summary": "Baichuan-M3 is a new AI medical assistant that acts more like a real doctor by asking questions to gather information, rather than just answering patient questions. It can actively investigate symptoms, reason through complex medical cases, and avoid making up false information. The system outperforms existing AI models including GPT-5.2 on medical decision-making tasks.",
      "key_insight": "Shifts medical AI from passive question-answering to active clinical inquiry, mimicking how physicians systematically gather patient information; Implements three core capabilities: proactive information gathering, long-horizon reasoning to connect scattered evidence, and adaptive hallucination suppression for factual accuracy; Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HealthBench, HealthBench-Hallu, and ScanBench, outperforming GPT-5.2 in clinical inquiry, advisory quality, and safety",

Instead of human feedback, the system uses a set of principles (a 'constitution') to guide an AI to critique and improve its own responses, then uses AI-generated preferences to train the model through reinforcement learning.",

The approach requires no additional training data or models, using a single language model to generate, provide feedback, and refine outputs iteratively. Testing across 7 different tasks showed approximately 20% improvement over standard single-pass generation.",
