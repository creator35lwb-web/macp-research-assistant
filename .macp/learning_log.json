      "summary": "This paper provides the first comprehensive survey examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research workflows. The authors systematically analyze LLM applications across four key research stages: generating hypotheses, planning experiments, writing papers, and conducting peer reviews. The survey identifies current challenges and proposes future directions for using AI to accelerate scientific discovery.",
      "key_insight": "LLMs are being applied across the entire scientific research lifecycle, from initial hypothesis generation through peer review, representing a fundamental shift in how research is conducted; Each research stage requires task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks tailored to the unique requirements of scientific work; Current LLM applications in science face significant challenges including domain-specific knowledge limitations, evaluation difficulties, and the need for specialized benchmarks",
