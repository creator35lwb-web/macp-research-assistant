  MACP Research Assistant is an open-source tool for tracking, tracing, and
  recalling AI-powered research with complete citation provenance across multiple
  AI assistants. It implements the Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MACP) v2.0
  to solve the problem of lost context, forgotten insights, and scattered citations
  when using multiple AI tools for research. Key innovations include: (1) MACP-based
  research tracking with full provenance chains, (2) Multi-AI agent coordination
  with structured handoffs, (3) Knowledge recall system enabling natural language
  queries across research history, (4) Citation network linking papers to projects
  with agent attribution, (5) Knowledge graph generation mapping relationships
  between papers, concepts, agents, and projects. The architecture adopts emerging
  standards including llms.txt for AI agent discoverability and skill.md for agent
  usability, positioning MACP as a proto-A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for the
  agentic web.
